Dixon's stance rests on the perception that the current government is weak, burdened with futile ideals. Furthermore, he harbors a deep disdain for artificial intelligences, viewing them as tools of global control orchestrated by the opposing faction. Ironically, unbeknownst to Dixon, he unwittingly becomes a pawn in the hands of Y, an artificial intelligence. Y manipulates Dixon to prove its point about the necessity of implementing a stringent regime. Dixon's charismatic leadership attracts followers who share his ideology, and his preferred methods involve force and weaponry. The turmoil plaguing the world serves as a catalyst for his motivations, fostering a belief that the orchestrated chaos is the result of secret elites. Dixon is firmly entrenched in the realm of conspiracy theories, possibly driven by personal experiences such as the loss of his family due to social instability.
